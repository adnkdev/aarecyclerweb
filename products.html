                <h2>Tyre crumb granulation</h2>
                <p>At A&A recyclers, we specialise in granulation production converting used tyres to small granulated tyre crumb rubber. When our experienced team collect your tyres, they are safely stored in our Environment Protection Act (EPA) approved facility. From there, your tyres are then placed into a tyre shredder and broken down in smaller chips. Then, they are fed through our granulator where the metal fibers are separated from the rubber chips. These are further broken down in crumb rubber particles using a heating process called pyrolysis. These have many uses in the sporting, automotive, construction and rubber product industries.</p>

                <h2>Truck casing</h2>
                <p>Truck tyres usability can be enhanced through the process of re-treading. Used Truck tyres that we collect can be recycled into cheaper costing and less environmentally costly new Truck tyres. We send your disposed tyres to tyre re-treading facility, where the truck casings are coated in melted rubber and the tyre patterns are reprinted on. Research has shown that these tyres are exhibit similar performance to completely new truck tyres and are manufactured at a fraction of the cost.

                <h2>Safe disposal of Tyres </h2>
                <p>In just Australia, over 48 million tyres are disposed in bushlands or left in abandoned warehouses. Increasing temperatures in Australia due to climate change, have caused these unused tyres to pose an environment hazard to urban living and wildlife. We as Australians should take responsibility for our ecological footprint and ensure that our waste is appropriately dealt with. A&A recyclers ensures that your tyres are recycled into usable material through our granulation processes, and improving life-cycle of truck tyres through re-treading of truck casings. Our services are approved by the Environment Protection Act (EPA), enabling us to contribute to a greener circular economy whilst also decreasing the damaging effects of tyre pollution in our society. </p>
